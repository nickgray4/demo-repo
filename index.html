    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h3>Logical Systems Incorporated</h3>
    <p>
        My first internship was at LSI. I mainly did shop work with tools because I was a Freshman/Sophomore. Eventually, they allowed me to work on marking up
        <br>
        drawings on AutoCAD and to test the panels that we built with code.
    </p>
    <h3>High Performance Computing Collaboratory</h3>
    <p>
        My second and most recent internship was at the HPCC on campus. I still work there now as a student researcher. I mainly work on deep learning models
        <br>
        and on image augmentation. I also go on trips with our drone specialists to help gather data.
